# OntoFNCT

This repository for OntoFNCT is a valuable and freely accessible resource for researchers, scientists, 
and engineers working in the field of materials science and structural integrity. 
This repository houses a wealth of information, including ontology files, exemplary primary, secondary, and metadata, 
and details on the development of the Full-Notch Creep Test Ontology (OntoFNCT).

OntoFNCT is a specialized ontology designed to facilitate the understanding and analysis of full-notch creep tests, 
a critical component of material characterization and structural integrity assessment. This ontology provides 
a structured framework for representing the various aspects of full-notch creep testing, encompassing standards, 
methodologies, materials, and experimental data. By utilizing OntoFNCT, researchers can enhance the semantic 
interoperability and knowledge representation of their data, enabling more effective data management, retrieval, 
and sharing. In general, OntoFNCT provides a possibility to store data originating from FNCT in a human and machine
readable format. Such data can be easily queried and combined with other data in similar formats.

Within the repository, users can access and download ontology files that are central to the OntoFNCT framework, 
promoting consistency and standardization in research and development. Additionally, the repository hosts 
exemplary primary data, secondary data, and metadata derived from full-notch creep tests, 
showcasing real-world applications and implementations of OntoFNCT. This data is also available in the open access
Zenodo repository [Dataset of comprehensive Full-notch creep tests (FNCT) of selected high-density polyethylene (PE-HD) materials](https://zenodo.org/records/10143352).

Furthermore, using classical GitHub functionality, the repository offers insights into the ongoing 
development and refinement of OntoFNCT, providing a transparent view of updates, enhancements, and best practices 
for ontology utilization. Users can stay up-to-date with the latest developments in OntoFNCT refinement.

## Documentation of Development Process

WIP - TBD

## Documents | Links
In this section, some documents and tools are listed (and linked, if applicable) that 
supported the ontology creation or provide some additional information.

+ [Repository of OntoFNCT](https://github.com/MarkusSchilling/ontoFNCT) | Files will be stored here, e.g., TTL file of OntoFNCT or exemplary RDF files
+ [OntoFNCT file](https://github.com/MarkusSchilling/ontoFNCT/blob/main/ontoFNCT.ttl) | TTL file of ontoFNCT (OWL file in TTL syntax)
+ [ontoFNCT auto-created documentation]() | A documentation of ontoFNCT auto-generated by Widoco tool
+ [Standard ISO 16770:2019-09](https://www.beuth.de/de/norm/iso-16770/314388720) | The ISO standard the ontoFNCT development is based on
+ [PMD Core Ontology (PMDco)](https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology) | The ontology in the field of materials sciences and engineering (MSE) ontoFNCT is based on
+ [Protégé tool](https://protege.stanford.edu/) | A tool used for the creation of ontologies; especially, annotations and relations were included in the ontology by applying the Protégé tool
+ [ontoFNCT data mapping example](https://github.com/MarkusSchilling/ontoFNCT/blob/main/ontoFNCT_data.ttl) | An example on how a TTL file may look like after actual FNCT data was mapped to ontoFNCT
+ [Zenodo repository for FNCT data](https://zenodo.org/records/10143352) | In this open access Zenodo repository, typical FNCT data can be found which may be used for digitalization efforts
+ [FNCT data on GitHub](https://github.com/MarkusSchilling/data) | FNCT data borrowed from open Zenodo repository provided in this GitHub repository, subdivided in primary data, secondary data, and metadata


## Namespaces
In this section, the namespaces used in ontoFNCT are listed. These can also be found in the [ontoFNCT.ttl file](https://github.com/MarkusSchilling/ontoFNCT/blob/main/ontoFNCT.ttl).
The ontological concepts of ontoFNCT use the namespace [https://w3id.org/ontofnct/](https://w3id.org/ontofnct/) which is registered as permanent URL and which is dereferencable.
Hence, ontoFNCT (IRI of the ontology) can be addressed by using https://w3id.org/ontofnct.
